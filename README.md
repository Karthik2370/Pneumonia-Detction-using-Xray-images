# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection Model

A deep learning project that uses chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia and classify its type (bacterial or fungal).

## 🧠 About the Project

This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-rays and assist in the early detection of pneumonia. It not only identifies whether a patient has pneumonia but also predicts the type — bacterial or fungal.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Classifies chest X-rays into:
  - Normal (No Pneumonia)
  - Bacterial Pneumonia
  - Fungal Pneumonia
- Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Powered by TensorFlow and Keras
- Provides high accuracy with clear visual predictions

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images. Each image is categorized into one of the following:
- **Normal**
- **Bacterial Pneumonia**
- **Fungal Pneumonia**

> Note: The dataset is assumed to be pre-cleaned and properly labeled.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python
- 🧠 TensorFlow / Keras
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- 🖼️ OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)
- 📁 NumPy & Pandas

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. Load and preprocess chest X-ray images
2. Normalize and resize input images
3. Train a CNN model to extract features
4. Use softmax for multi-class classification
5. Evaluate on a separate test set
6. Predict the result for new X-ray uploads

## 📈 Model Performance

The model was trained with care to avoid overfitting and ensure generalization. Evaluation was done using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

> You can integrate this model into web or mobile applications to aid real-time diagnostics.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This project is intended for **research and educational purposes only** and should not be used for real medical diagnosis without clinical validation.
